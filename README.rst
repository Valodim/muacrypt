muacrypt: Support for encrypting Mail User Agents
=================================================

``muacrypt`` is a set of automatically tested utilities, implemented in Python,
to help mail apps (Mail User Agents in particular) to grow `Autocrypt
<https://autocrypt.org>`_ capabilities as well as features that go
beyond the Level 1 specification.

Please refer to `core/README.rst <core/README.rst>`_
and the `muacrypt issues tracker <https://github.com/hpk42/py-autocrypt>`_
